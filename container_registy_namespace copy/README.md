The following example creates a namespace in the default resource group with a name of your choice and attaches an image retention policy to that namespace that retains 10 images. To retrieve the ID of the default resource group, the ibm_resource_group data source is used. Then, the user is assigned the Manager role in the IAM access policy for the namespace for a particular region. The region is retrieved from the terraform.tfvars.
